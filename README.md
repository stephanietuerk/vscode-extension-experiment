# readability-check README

This is Stephanie's VS Code extension that makes use of the `text-readability` library.

## Features

This is an extension that helps you understand the readability of prose. When sentences are too complex given your target reading level, it also provides you with suggestions to simplify the text.

It works on plaintext and markdown files.

After loading the extension, you will see a "Readability" button on the left side of the status bar at the bottom of the screen. You can use this button to turn the readability check on and off. This button will also show you information about the readability level for the entire document.

When the extension has been toggled on, it will highlight sentences that are too complex for your target reading level. You can hover over the highlighted text to see the readability score and suggestions for simplifying the text.

You can set your target reading level with the Command Palette command "Set Readability Level".
